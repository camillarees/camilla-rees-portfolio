        "about": "I have a passion for social justice through nonprofit work and education and have been in these fields for several years. I decided to shift my focus to Software Development and learned I have a particular knack for front-end development and have been complimented on my eye for design by my supervisor and colleagues. I‚Äôm known to be a ‚ÄúJill of all trades‚Äù, and am extremely interested in picking up iOS development. I am eager to combine these new skills with my previous experience to educate and engage communities to act for the public good through technology. Through my experience, I have witnessed an immense positive impact on societal ecosystems when we improve the ways we connect good people with the right resources and opportunities. I want to continue this mission as I step into a tech industry role.",
